# Security-Constrained-Unit-Commitment--Benders-Decomposition
Considering the global warming the power generation is going to be based on renewable generation. Between renewable generation wind power is one of the fastest growing renewable sources of energy generation in the U.S. and many other countries. Wind energy is a desirable resource because it’s cheap and clean. However, it’s intermittent, and the profile of energy generation does not correlate with the demand cycle. Wind energy is available when the wind blows, and the power level depends on wind speed. Therefore, they are not dispatched in the traditional sense. As installed wind capacity grows in a region, the intermittency of wind energy becomes a significant issue. This paper presents a security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) algorithm with the Benders Decomposition method for considering wind generation volatility.
